    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>All of the art in this section is done in various mediums such as ink, charcoal, pen, and graphite. The replicated shoe that I made is only made of tape. 
        The character design project was an assignment in which we had to reimagine a character from the Wizard of Oz. I made my character in the Procreate app.</p>
