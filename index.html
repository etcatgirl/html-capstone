    <img src="./images/me, very professional.jpg" height="250px" alt="me!">
    <p>Hello, and welcome to a resume site that I've created using only html! This is a resume that I will be continuously adding onto as I improve my skills. 
        I'm very passionate about art, creating, and design which has led me in an endless pursuit to improve my skills! My coding journey has just begun as of early February 2024 and my art journey began in September of 2022.
        I will be showcasing both the web development skills I've learned thus far, as well as my art progress.</p>
